DRO
===

A home made DRO for a lathe.

Uses an I2C LCD with two buttons.

Uses 
AS5306 linear encoder http://www.ams.com/ger/Products/Position-Sensors/Linear-Incremental-Magnetic-Position-Sensors/AS5306

1.2mm pole length mag strip http://www.ams.com/ger/Products/Position-Sensors/Magnets/AS5000-MS12-250

PCB from here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1409
or http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5608
I had the latter sent to OSHPark and got three boards made

The components I got from Digikey
The magnetic strip I got direct from AMS  http://www.ams.com

I made a little slider to hold the board a fixed distance from the strip as required, these are
included in this repo.
